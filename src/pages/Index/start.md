Why did i start this project ?
I want to know enought about web development to be able to create
an app from scratch.

I ran into [ran into - столькнуться с ] a problem where you know about some
of the steps, but don't have the full view of all steps and you can't
connect them.

This project is designed to create a complete picture to create an app.

At this stage, I know a little bit about frontend and backend. Adaptive layout,
media queries.
Some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, mobX, TypeScript. I have a very superficial idea about databases.
